The total bot score is not a simple average of others subtotal, this is weighted according to the importance of the index and also to the context

For example an user score equal to 0 because it is an official labeled account, will weight 3 times more in the final score because the probability to be a bot is very low.

The Network and Temporal are more weighted because they are more significant about bot spotting.

But they are not simply more weighted, the independent calculation of these index can be more than 1.0 (100%). So it will be more heavy in the final score, but the final score will never be more than 100% (after calculation adjustment)

Network usually overpass 1.0 more than temporal

But the independent index score showed never overpass 100% because they are divided and adjusted between being used in the final calculation and being showed.

It might be possible to have a final score higher than every others index score.
